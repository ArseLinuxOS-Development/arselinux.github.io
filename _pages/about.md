## For fun and learning

I was reading a conversation on Matrix in the ArchLinux room where a user mentioned it would be funny if there was a distribution called Arselinux, mainly because the domain would so close to Archlinux.org, I saw the domain was available and just bought it. Within 5 minutes someone in that room noticed it was unavailable and they laughed about it.

I sat on the domain for a while thinking ultimately what I will do with it, so I figured I'd use it as a vehicle for learning.

 - Building my own ISO which teaches me more of how Linux is built and what is required.
 - Repositories and packaging
 - Working with git and Github
 - Managing a little website for the project
 - And whatever else comes from it.

Ultimately this is pointless to be used as a daily driver but that's not the point. The point is to just have a bit of fun and use that fun to expedite my learning.
